> Theory Question Bank Version 2

# This is a Vue learning project

This project can be used as a tool for brushing questions-as long as you generate your own question bank file according to the template, and then import it, you can start using it.

# Other

- The project uses Service Worker, which can run perfectly offline.
- Through this project, I initially learned Vue and PWA technology.
- PWA is really great technology! ! ! It allows web applications to have the same experience as native apps.
- Because it is the first time to use Webpack, the whole project seems a bit clumsy. . . Make do with it!
